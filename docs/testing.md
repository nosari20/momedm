# Manual test checklist (two physical devices)

## A. Controller standalone
- [ ] Fresh install on phone A (not device owner) → permission gate shows 5 permissions; after granting, Devices screen.
- [ ] Advertising toggle ON → persistent notification "Môme DM controller"; OFF → notification gone, banner shown.
- [ ] Provision screen, Hotspot mode → Generate QR → SSID/pass filled, "Serving APK at <ip>" and QR visible. Browser on another device on that hotspot: `http://<ip>:8080/momedm.apk` downloads.
- [ ] Manual mode with your Wi-Fi → QR visible; Custom URL mode → QR visible without server.
- [ ] Settings → Controller: id + fingerprint shown; Regenerate → fingerprint changes, service restarts.

## B. Provisioning device B (factory reset)
- [ ] Tap welcome screen 6×, scan QR (hotspot) → Wi-Fi joins, APK downloads, "Set up your device" → our wizard (account step, usage step) → home = Môme DM managed screen.
- [ ] If download fails on hotspot: retry with Manual (shared LAN) mode; if `http://` refused: Custom URL mode with an https host. Record which worked in this file.
- [ ] Hotspot security type: QR declares WPA; if the hotspot came up WPA3-only the managed device may fail to join → use Manual mode.
- [ ] `adb shell dumpsys device_policy | grep -i owner` shows `edu.fnosari.momedm`.

## C. Link + commands
- [ ] B shows "Looking for controller…" then banner disappears (AUTHENTICATED) within ~10 s of A advertising. A's Devices list shows B online with model.
- [ ] Refresh status → card updates (battery, account yes/no, kiosk no).
- [ ] Kiosk ON → app picker lists B's apps (non-ASCII labels intact) → pick one → B enters lock task in that app; A shows kiosk=pkg. Back/home blocked on B.
- [ ] Kiosk OFF → B returns to managed home; status kiosk=no.
- [ ] Install (e.g. `org.mozilla.firefox`) with account on B → Play listing opens (also while kiosk ON).
- [ ] Install (kiosk OFF) → Play listing opens normally (not pinned in lock task; Back/Home still work on B).
- [ ] Add account → Google sign-in flow opens on B (kiosk OFF).
- [ ] Snackbar on A shows `OK: ...` / `ERR: ...` for every command.

## D. Resilience
- [ ] Toggle Bluetooth off/on on A → B reconnects and re-authenticates (backoff visible in logcat `ManagedLinkService`).
- [ ] Reboot B with kiosk ON → kiosk app relaunches, link re-established.
- [ ] Reboot B with kiosk OFF → managed home, link re-established.
- [ ] Second managed device C → both online simultaneously; commands go to the right device.
- [ ] Controller with a different secret (regenerate on A) → B never authenticates, A shows B offline, B keeps scanning; re-provision fixes it.
- [ ] Logcat on A shows unauthenticated centrals dropped after 5 s.
